Some introduction to working practice, mainly through example:

* Version control
* Testing
* +- github
* IPython notebooks (when to use and when not to use)

Image manipulation
==================

Read a 3D image as a numpy array
Show image slices with matplotlib

Read a 4D image as a numpy array
Show image slices with matplotlib
Get and plot timeseries

Load affine from Nifti file
Find 0, 0, 0 (real space) voxel
(Visualize image with non-trivial affine)
(Show registration of two images with non-trivial affine)
(Futz with affine to improve registration)

Plot the timeseries for that voxel using matplotlib

Finding information in the nifti header
(e.g. get slice, frequency, phase)

Writing a 3D image
Set negative voxels to zero?
Set background voxels to zero?
Set NaN or Inf voxels to zero?
Applying a binary mask to an image?
Doing math on images (+ - / *) (covered by mean, std etc below?)

Reading image data from a DICOM image
Getting information from the DICOM header
DIOCM formats - Siemens, Philips

Basic diagnostics

* mean image
* standard deviation image
* min / max images
* global signal plots
* time series differences a la tsdiffana
* Detecting some common artifacts (RF, slice dropout - with examples)
* (automated spike detection?)
* PCA plots / images with nipy?

fMRI preprocessings
===================

Slice timing correction

* Extract timeseries from first slice and middle slice
* Plot on same plot
* Time-series interpolation (NN, linear, spline, sinc) and resampling
* Some nasty timeseries (spikes) (and what happens with different
  interpolations)

Realignment

* On 2D slices
* The idea of a cost function
* The idea of 2D resampling
* Trying different transformations to reduce the cost function (combining cost
  function and resampling)
* Finding a best X translation
* Finding a best X and a best Y translation
* The idea of the local minimum
* Extrapolating to 3D
* Using the best images for realignment
  * Mean image to time point images for within-run
  * Mean image to mean image between runs

Distortion correction

* (the problem at least)

Order of steps

* Problem of slice timing and realignment
* Problem of distortion correction relative to both

Spatial normalization

* Visualizing native space (what is 0, 0, 0)
* Compare native space between brains
* Find the central sulcus, calcarine sulcus, Heschl's gyrus) on two brains
* (Freesurfer surface here?  PySurfer?)
* The idea of MNI space
* The MNI templates
* (?The Juelich cytoarchitecture data?)
* How best to match our two subject's brains?
* How best to match the brains to the MNI template?
* (Purpose of normalization)
* Cost functions for normalization
* Methods of normalization (shape matching, matching sulci)
* An affine normalization in nipy (find the best parameters for cost-function,
  optimization method)
* (?Lesions and cost-functions?)

Diagnostics

Getting ready for the statistical analysis
PCA with nipy again
(is there still movement artifact?)
(is there still slice-timing artifact?)

Statistics part I: Modelling and testing one voxel / one region
===============================================================

A) First recall simple linear regression
----------------------------------------

An example with simple regression and independent noise
* fitting the model : finding the model's parameters 
* Noise : properties of the noise - what is a good versus a bad fit ?
* Testing one parameter: t-test, F-test


B) First level analyses : case of correlated noise: whitening
-------------------------------------------------------------

    - Going from neural events to BOLD responses - 
    - Several experimental conditions: multiple regression 
    - Nuisance variable (eg mvt parameters)
    - AR estimation 
    - Event related models : one hrf  / several basis functions - F-test testing

C) Second level analyses:  
---------------------------

    - Why a second level analysis at all ? The idea of several variance components
    - Modelling factors and interactions (between subject factor only), how to interpret the contrasts 
    - take the example of a 2 or 3 ways ANOVA model : how do I specify the
      contrasts ?
    - Mixed effects analyses: within and between factors examples

D) Diagnostic tools ?
---------------------

    - univariate ?
    - multivariate ?

Statistics part II: multiple comparison issues
==============================================

    - Family wise error concept: correcting for the number of tests
    - Detection at the voxel level, detection at the cluster level
    - Techniques for FWE correction : 
        - Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) 
        - Permutation 
    - False discovery rate correction: sensitivity and specificity - Effect
      size, how many subjects, ...
    - Conjunctions ?

Other analyses: 
================

- machine learning
- Resting state / activation connectivity (functional, effective ...)
- ...

Questions
*********

What should we use for volumetric visualization?

* A crummy matplotlib viewer (we have a few lying around)
* Eleftherios' fancy new viewer?  (need to review) (probably needs Qt / PySide)
* fslview
* SPM :)
